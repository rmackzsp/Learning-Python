I know that this thread is supposed to be about me learning Python.  However this post is about me learning how to use Git, so that I can learn how to use GitHub, so that I can actually post my progress in learning Python.

First I did a search on Youtube, in order to find a video on how to use GitHub and found the following video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw 

While following along with the video I ran into a problem. Git was still reading the file that the video said should be deleted.  I went back and watch the video again and noticed that in the video that he highlighted the .txt file extension and that when I renamed my file that the .txt extension was not an option to delete. 

I did a Google search and found the following video https://www.google.com/search?q=remove+txt+extension+windows+11&sca_esv=567916741&sxsrf=AM9HkKk5Uvxp2zjq0z_SUAO5h44vKp3SOQ%3A1695518370679&ei=oo4PZfeLKcCS0PEPlMW-uAE&oq=remove+.txt+from+filename&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiGXJlbW92ZSAudHh0IGZyb20gZmlsZW5hbWUqAggBMgoQABhHGNYEGLADMgoQABhHGNYEGLADMgoQABhHGNYEGLADMgoQABhHGNYEGLADMgoQABhHGNYEGLADMgoQABhHGNYEGLADMgoQABhHGNYEGLADMgoQABhHGNYEGLADSOYUUABYAHABeAGQAQCYAQCgAQCqAQC4AQPIAQDiAwQYACBBiAYBkAYI&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#kpvalbx=_xY4PZbDTLo-G0PEPqJ6ggAw_34

Which explained how to make it so that I would have access to the .txt file extension in Windows 11

Rename the file deleting the extension, opened the file and wrote the code to exclude the the .txt files, saved it and checked again and found that it matched the video now.

Continued following along with the video and didnâ€™t have any other problems, though I think I will need to write a cheat sheet for all the new commands that I will have to remember for using Git.
