Day 05 Strings

Strings like variables can be just about anything, letters, numbers, symbols.  Something new that I learned was that you can use (’’’) in order to deal with words that have a ‘ in them.  I also did not know about using a \ to deal with those as well, but having used them in the example I can see why it would be confusing and I don’t think that I will be using it in my coding.  

I have never heard of f-strings before, so I look forward to seeing how I will use those.  I think I might want to start creating a cheat sheet for quick reference
