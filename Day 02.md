Day 02
Downloaded Python and opened IDLE. 
Did the first exercise “Hello World”
I then spent the next hour trying to figure out how to get the file I created in IDLE into GitHub.  I found a video on Youtube that helped to show me how to upload the file that I wanted too.

I then uploaded the file to the repository and then copied the documentation that I had into a text file and uploaded it as well.  I noticed that the txt file was hard to read compared to the Read Me file.  I then changed the text file extension to .md and tried to upload that file and found that it was a lot more readable.
