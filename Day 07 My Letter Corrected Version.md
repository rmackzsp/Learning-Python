Day 07 My Letter Corrected Version

I have spoke with a friend and found that I wrote the code in the wrong place.  I wrote it in the shell and I should of written it in note pad instead.  I rewrote the letter in note pad and tried to run it again, and found that the formatting of the letter did not match that of the letter in the book.  I ended up doing a Google search to see why the format didnâ€™t match.  I found the following article.

On page three I noticed that format of the letter in the PDF was different them the one in the book.  I tried the change that I found in the PDF in my own coding and tried it out.  I found that it worked.
