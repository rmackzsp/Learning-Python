Day 03  Calculating in Python

Today I worked on Calculating in Python.  While the basic operation is fairly simple, I think that I spent more time copying the book word problems to make the math problems actually make sense then I did actually doing the math equations.  

On the bright side, I did work on inputting comments into my code, which I have heard is a good habit to get into.
